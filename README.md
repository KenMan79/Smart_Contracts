Contracts for SafeHaven (platform, token, crowdsale)

Vesting contracts are also going to be added soon

### Description of the auditing Work.
```
  Solidity code analysis

  test the code for syntactical, semantic, and logical errors.
  Static analysis against our proprietary set of known issues and vulnerabilities
  Unit testing with our suite of tools that include both open and closed source
  New tests written and run to ensure the code behaves as desired
  Manual review for logic errors
  Fuzz testing to find unknown issues or vulnerabilities
```


### ERC20 Token contracts.
```
Even though we moved on to Vechain, deploying an ERC20 token contract on Ethereum was nescesairy to solve to issue our primablock contributors were having. We created a limited supply on Ethereum with the solely purpose of performing a swap afterwards.
