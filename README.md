## SafeHaven

### Ethereum Token contracts. (ERC20)

Even though we moved to the Vechain Enterprise Blockchain, deploying an ERC20 token contract on Ethereum was necessary to solve an issue our primablock contributors were having. We created a limited supply on Ethereum with the solely purpose of performing a swap afterwards.
